Draghi’s ascension to the European stage alongside Macron and Merkel also implies closer EU-US relations. US President Joe Biden could not find a better ally in Europe. Italy’s new government, Draghi vowed, will be “strongly pro-European and Atlanticist, in line with Italy’s historical anchors.” This marks a break with the foreign policy of Giuseppe Conte, the previous prime minister, who had aligned Italy more closely with China. Draghi is giving the transatlantic alliance a chance to recover after four years of Donald Trump’s strategic recklessness.
