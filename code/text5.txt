AllianceChicago community health centers have their own unique research review processes and may include formal Institutional Review Board (IRB) review and/or in-person presentations to community review boards. We help our collaborating researchers navigate the research review process by serving as an administrative liaison. AllianceChicagoâ€™s IRB of Record is the Chicago Department of Public Health Institutional Review Board.
